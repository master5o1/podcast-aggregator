I have not seen the film, so I can’t speak to its merits or shortcomings, but while people are possibly being introduced to the concept of the Green Book for the first time, we thought we’d re-release this story from a few years ago about the origin and significance of the Green Book: the Negro Motorists’ Travel Guide to the segregated US. 

As a special bonus to our story, we also have a Green Book story from Nate DiMeo of <a href="http://thememorypalace.us/" target="_blank">the memory palace</a>. Nate had coincidentally written his episode called “Open Road” and we both released them without having heard the other. I think hearing them one after the other is real treat.

Her books always have strong female leads who navigate their way through tough times from 1850s to the 1950s New Zealand. An historian by trade, Deborah Challinor's PhD was in military history, which is a far cry from her latest book - From the Ashes. It is a sequel to her 2006 book Fire - and is the second book in the series, The Restless Years. Deborah often writes several books that focus on particular characters because she says their stories don't stop on the last page of the novel. Her most successful and best loved series are the Children of War books, The Smugglers Wife series and Convict Girls. Deborah joins Lynn to talk about her prolific writing career and the characters that stay with her.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RNZ: Nine To Noon: Former Parisian model and beachwear designer from Los Angeles Jill Dodd was also a pleasure wife to one of the world's richest men in the 1980s: Adnan Khashoggi, the billionaire Middle Eastern arms dealer - a womanizer with three wives and 11 pleasure wives at his beck and call. Several inches shorter and twice her age, he reminded Jill of her friend's father. Jill appeared in Paris Vogue, Marie Claire, French Cosmopolitan, Olympe, American Glamour, Bazaar, Mademoiselle, and Teen among other glossy magazines. She made a very successful transition from model to fashion designer as the founder and designer of global fashion surfing and sports brand ROXY, which she started under the umbrella of Quicksilver. Jill talks to Lynn Freeman about her years modelling in Paris and with Khashoggi in the early 80s, which she has written about in a new book called The Currency of Love.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[On-line exam glitch: "I panicked for 20 minutes"]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[RNZ: Nine To Noon: A secondary school principal says the failure of a server which saw potentially thousands of students have an on-line exam interrupted is cause for concern. Students sitting their first ever digital NCEA level 1 English paper have reported to Nine to Noon they panicked for up to twenty minutes, while their screens froze, before it was clear to them that they could proceed with the exam on-line. Others opted to complete the exam on paper. Tony Kane, principal of Kapiti College, one of the schools taking part in the pilot programme testing-out digital exams, says this raises questions about how well prepared the qualifications authority is for its plan to make all exams fully digital in by 2020. 3,631 students were registered to take part in the Level 1 English Pilot exam, across 38 schools. NZQA have reassured students they have robust processes in place to ensure that no student is disadvantaged. Lynn Freeman speaks with Tony Kane, Kapiti college Year 11 student Hayley Searancke and NZQA's Deputy Chief Executive Digital Assessment Transformation, Andrea Gray.]]></description>
